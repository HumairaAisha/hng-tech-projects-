         <h2 >Biography</h2>
         <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Aisha Muhyiddeen Ahmad</strong>, a passionate frontend developer and creative problem-solver from Nigeria.
            I love building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences that combine thoughtful design with strong functionality. <br>Beyond code, I believe in community and innovation.</p>

      <section data-testid="test-about-goals">
         <h2>Goals in this program</h2>
         <p>My main goal in this program is to grow into a confident, independent developer who can build functional and user-friendly web applications from scratch. I want to strengthen my understanding of frontend, improve my ability to structure projects, and learn to think critically about design and user experience. Most importantly, I want to finish the program with a sense of clarity, knowing how far I’ve come and how much more I can build.</p>

      <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
         <h2>Areas of low confidence</h2>
         <p>I sometimes struggle with self-doubt, especially when I don’t understand a concept as fast as I expect to. Debugging and advanced JavaScript logic can still feel overwhelming at times. But I’ve learned to slow down, ask better questions, and give myself permission to grow at my own pace. Every challenge now feels like an opportunity to become a little more patient and resilient.</p>

         <h2>Note to future self</h2>
         <p>Dear future me, <br>
         Remember how far you’ve come from the days when you doubted if you could ever do this. You didn’t give up. You learned, relearned, and built things you once thought were impossible. Keep that same curiosity alive. Don’t measure your growth by speed, measure it by depth, honesty, and impact. You are still becoming.</p>

      <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
         <h2>Extra thoughts</h2>
         <p>This journey has taught me that progress isn’t always loud sometimes it’s in quiet breakthroughs and small consistent steps. Every late night spent debugging, every “aha” moment after days of confusion, every small project they all matter. I’ve realized that learning is not a race, it’s a rhythm and I’m learning to move at my own pace.</p>
